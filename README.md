Gui for scratchpkg

This package is created free to be used as you see fit. 

This is for the scratchpkg manager.

You will need to place the file "outdated" in /usr/bin for the outdated packages button to work properly.

This program was created in qt creator.

The folder name is unfortunately called untitled1 - I did this as a "test" project 

It "might" be buggy - this is just a project I chose to do in my spare time. 

My personal desktop that this works on is KDE/Plasma with QT.

This project comes with no warranty - if you think you can do better or add an improvement please let me know so I can add to the project and reupload to the repository.

This project when compiled will create a file named untitled1 you can rename it to something else and put it in /usr/bin and it will be an executable you can bring up.

Dependencies needed:
QT 5.15.1
