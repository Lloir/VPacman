Gui for scratchpkg

This package is created free to be used as you see fit. 

This is for the scratchpkg manager.

You will need to place the file "outdated" in /usr/bin for the outdated packages button to work properly.

This program was created in qt creator.

The folder name is unfortunately called untitled1 - I did this as a "test" project
